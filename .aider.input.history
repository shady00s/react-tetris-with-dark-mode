+# Update the classes nVeA, DOXx, _1fjB to inherit the current theme's background color
+# and set their direct children to have contrasting text colors for visibility.
+# Ensure this works with both light and dark themes by using theme-aware properties.
+# The solution should:
+# 1. Find all elements with classes nVeA, DOXx, or _1fjB
+# 2. Apply the current theme's background color to these elements
+# 3. For all direct children of these elements:
+#    - Set text color to be opposite of the background (dark text on light bg, light text on dark bg)
+#    - Maintain proper color contrast for accessibility
+# 4. Handle nested cases where children might also have these classes
+# 5. Use CSS variables if available to make theming consistent

+now i want you to separate the rendering logic of toggle localization and toggle theme to prevent each one from reset the other 

# 2025-05-04 17:11:25.255127
+now there is an issue, when i press on the localization toggle button it resets the theme to the default theme

# 2025-05-04 17:15:32.300102
+still the issue exists, also i noticed that the theme=dark is not changed but the theme is reseted

# 2025-05-04 17:20:55.049930
+now when i set the theme to dark mode and then press the `languageToggle` button, it resets the theme to light mode
