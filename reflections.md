I tried Aider in both creating a React tetris game from scratch using Gemini 2.5 API ( repo: https://github.com/shady00s/tetris ) the result was good for creating a simple titres game with the basic features.

When I switched to OptoGPT locale LLM Qwen:32, the result was not as good as Gemini 2.5 API. I also tried DeepSeek chat and it was good but with very clear and strict instructions (Ex: I needed to add specific classes and how to deal with the internal sub-classes).

also, I needed to brutly add all the files in the src folder to make deepseek understands the context of the project.
