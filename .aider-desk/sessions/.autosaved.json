To add a localization button for English and Chinese, I need to understand the project structure first.\n\nCould you please provide the list of files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories? Specifically, I'm looking for the main application component (like `App.tsx` or `App.js`), component files (potentially in a `components` directory), and any existing internationalization setup (like `i18n.js`, `locales`, etc.).\n\nAlternatively, I can use a tool to search for these files. What approach do you prefer?"

Let me know once they are added."
